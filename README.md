# QAP 2 - SQL - Database
## Author: Noah Devine
## Due: Monday, February 10th

- Within this repo you will find two markdown files containing all required SQL code to solve both problems on the QAP.
-  I ran into an issue with my original repo so I needed to recreate the repo here. This shouldn't affect anything as all code is tried and tested.
-  Hopefully a markdown file will make it easier for you to test the code in pgAdmin.
